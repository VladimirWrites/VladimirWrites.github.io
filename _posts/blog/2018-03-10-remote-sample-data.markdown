description: Doing copy/paste of the sample data from one project to another is not an option.
---
What I've learned from my previous [article]({% post_url blog/2018-02-18-layout-preview %}) is that the best way to gain new knowledge about a certain topic is to write about it. When I first wrote the article, I had no idea that you can create custom sampledata for your Android project. (If you don't have a clue what sampledata is, please read [tools:title="LayoutPreview"]({% post_url blog/2018-02-18-layout-preview %})) And then someone sent me [this](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/tool-time-part-2/).

It sounded like a really cool feature, so I made the list of my favourite characters from Lord of the Rings, used it as `sampledata`, and got this glorious layout preview.

Later on, I wanted to include it in my other projects, but the only option that I had was to copy/paste the `sampledata` from one project to another, and that didn‚Äôt make any sense. Then I did what every (lazy) developer would do, asked a [question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48874434/use-sample-data-directory-from-a-library).

After 10 views and no answer in sight, I‚Äôve decided to sacrifice a bit of my reputation and start a bounty. And it worked. I got my answer, which I will share with you.

To use `sampledata` between multiple projects you first have to host it and then have a Gradle script which will download it into your project‚Äôs `sampledata` folder. This is the code which does that:

{% gist VladimirWrites/b7bb9fdedebf535f4d9ee78ca2ca39b8 %}

The first script will delete `sampledata` once you do clean build, and the second one will create `sampledata` folder in case it doesn‚Äôt exist, and then download sample files into it. It works like a charm and from now on you can go crazy with your layout previews. I know that from now on I will never again use `@tools:sample/lorem/random`.

This code can be found in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/VladimirWrites/tools-sample).

I‚Äôve also added some sample data, and will keep adding more. If you notice that something is missing or could be improved, feel free to contribute. This could be a great opportunity for novice developers to make their first contribution üòâ.
