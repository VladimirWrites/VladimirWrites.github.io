[Kotlin Multiplatform Libraries](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/kotlin-multiplatform-libraries) is my first course made for [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning).

Kotlin Multiplatform makes it easier to share code across Android, iOS, JVM, web, and backend platforms. In this course, Vladimir Jovanović teaches you how to create and publish a KMP library step by step. Learn how to set up a project, write and test cross-platform code, and handle platform-specific implementations. By the end, you should be ready to publish your library to Maven Central and maintain it effectively.

Learning objectives:
 - Build a Kotlin Multiplatform library that works for Android, iOS, JVM, and JS.
 - Configure Gradle to manage dependencies and settings for all targets.
 - Write platform-specific code and share logic across platforms.
 - Publish a KMP library to a public repository like Maven Central.
 - Test a KMP library on multiple platforms to ensure it works as expected.
