One of the biggest hurdles when it comes to Android development is the release process. Web developers can release new features almost instantly to all of their users, however, the process for an Android application takes a long time, and there is no guarantee that users are ever going to update the app. To combat this problem Google created Firebase Remote Config. In this course, Firebase on Android: Remote Config and A/B Testing, you’ll learn to use Firebase Remote Config and A/B testing that will enable you to improve your app’s performance and user experience. First, you’ll explore Remote Config and see how it can be integrated into the Android project. Next, you’ll discover how to change the behavior of the app using Remote Config flags. Finally, you’ll learn how to use A/B testing to test new features and improve the user experience. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of Firebase Remote Config and A/B testing needed to improve your Android application.
